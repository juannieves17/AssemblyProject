Assembly Project
================
Pure assembly program that inputs a string of up to 256 bytes, looks for any substring that is an integer number, counts them and it adds them up. Then prints the number (count) of those substrings as well as the total. Also, it has a procedure that replaces every substring that is an integer number with its reverse.
